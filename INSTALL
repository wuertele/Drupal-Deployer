Installation
------------

1. Copy this directory to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal will
   automatically detect it. Then enable the module.

2. Create the SQL table. This depends a little on your system, but the
    most common method is:
      mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < recipe.mysql
      
3. Recommended, but not mandatory. Create a vocabulary (or several) for classifying recipes and associate recipe.module with that vocabulary

4. Recommended, but not mandatory. Install the taxonomy_dhtml.module. You will get a nice taxonomy browser on your main recipe page. This
lets users browse all recipes for 'Fish' or 'Dessert' for example.

Upgraders
------------
If you are upgrading from a version of recipe.module priori to 1/11/2004 then you need to
- run this SQL statement: ALTER TABLE `recipe` ADD `instructions` TEXT;
- run the updaterecipe.php script in this package. You do so
by copying to the root of your drupal site and requesting the 'updaterecipe.php' in your browser. this
copies data from your node table to the recipe table.
