	* recipe.module: - Updated the modules in the contributions
	  repository to use   'theme("function")' instead of
	  '$theme->function()'.  Hopefully I didn't   break anything.  If I
	  did, let me know.

	    The following modules need special attention (but should still
	  work as is):

	    1. The ldap_integration directory has its own user.module; I
	  haven't updated
	       the documentation bit that talks about themes.

	    2. The hotlist module uses '$theme->hotlist_del_icon'.  Should
	  be avoided
	       and somehow wrapped in a (larger) call to theme().

	    3. The image module has its own way of doing what 'theme()'
	  does (or the
	       former 'theme_invoke()').  Constructs like the one below (a)
	  look wrong
	       and (b) should be rewritten to properly use 'theme()'.  For
	  example:

	       $theme->box("foo", method_exists("bar") ? $theme->bar() :
	  $bar);

	       Search for "image_gallery_album", "image_gallery_home" and
	       "image_thumb_browser".  I've already changed '$theme->box()'
	  to
	       'theme()'.

	    4. The sidebar module uses '$theme->foreground' and
	  '$theme->background'.
	       Should be avoided and somehow wrapped in a (larger) call to
	  theme().

	    5. The org_informations module uses '$theme->separator()',
	  which is new to
	       me.

	    6. The taxonomy_filter module uses
	  '$theme->taxolist_filter_item()'.  It
	       should use 'theme("taxolist_filter_item")' instead.  I
	  haven't changed
	       it because it would probably fail to resolve the default
	  function if
	       not overridden by a theme.

	    7. The taxonomy_dhtml module's INSTALL file still talks about
	       '$theme->image'.

	    8. The xloadtree module's INSTALL file still talks about
	  '$theme->image'.

	    9. I haven't updated the style.module; too many $theme's,
	  though I don't
	       think it needs any updates.

	    [I'll try to update the sandboxes later on.]

	* INSTALL: added TODO item concerning indexing - just stuff all
	  indexable in body and let usual node indexing proceed

	* INSTALL, recipe.module, recipe.mysql: initial version of a recipe
	  module.

	  this is an attempt to get our mother's to use drupal :)

	  requires the version of Drupal in Kjartan's sandbox. Uses new
	  node API (but could easily be backported to 4.0)
