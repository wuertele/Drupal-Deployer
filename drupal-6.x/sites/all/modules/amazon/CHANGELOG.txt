6.x-1.2 release
===============
If you were using the Customer Reviews feature in a view or otherwise, you'll
have a broken view, since Amazon has dropped customer review data from their API.
Instead, there is now a data item called "Customer reviews iframe" which is a
link to customer review information provided by Amazon suitable for placement
in an iframe.
