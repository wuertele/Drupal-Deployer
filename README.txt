How to set the color, page width and enable drop menus.

Colour:

Pixture Reloaded uses the color module - this allows you to modify
the colour of the theme to your liking. There are 18 preset colour
combinations and you can genearet your own by using the colour picker
in the theme settings page - admin/build/themes/settings/pixture_reloaded


Width:

You can also set the overall width of your site (scroll to the 
bottom of the theme settins page). Instructions are included on the theme 
settings page.


Superfish Drop Menu:

1) Build a standard drupal menu. Set the correct levels to "expanded".

2) Disable Primary links in the theme settings AND check the setting 
   to enable Superfish (scroll to the bottom of the Pixture Reloaded 
	 theme settins page).
	 
3) Place the menu block in the Superfish region (using Drupals normal block
   configuration system). Your menu will be automagically rendered as a 
	 Drop menu.
	 
4) To modify the animation style and speed please see the following site
