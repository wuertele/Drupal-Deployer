The File Aliases module extends the default functionality of the FileField
module and the core Upload module by adding a token customizable alias, allowing
files to have cleaner paths - while files will still live under the defined File
system path, aliases make the file appear to exist anywhere you wish.

File Aliases was written and is maintained by Stuart Clark (deciphered).
