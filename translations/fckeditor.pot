msgid "<h3>Defining field inclusion/exclusions</h3><p>In order to specifically display FCKeditor on those text areas on which you need it, the FCKeditor module provides a powerfull method to define fields that should be enhanced with FCKeditor. The first choice you have to make is whether you want to display FCKeditor on all textareas and define a list of exceptions, or if you don't want to display FCKeditor unless it is specifically enabled. This choice is made in the @inclexclsetting setting.</p><p>Next, the list of exceptions has to be defined. This list follows a specific syntax: the path to a field is defined by appending the field name to the path, separated by a dot. The field <em>edit-log</em> on page <em>node/add/page</em> would thus be addressed as <em>node/add/page.edit-log</em>. You can use wildcards * and ? anywhere in this line. If you have a dot in your field name and it causes problems, you can escape it with a slash (\\).</p><p>Some examples:<br/><em>node/add/page</em>: matches all fields on <em>node/add/page</em>.<br/><em>*.edit-log</em>: matches all fields called edit-log on any page.<br/><em>node/add/*</em>: matches all fields on pages such as <em>node/add/page</em>, <em>node/add/story</em>, etc.<br/><em>node/add/*.edit-log</em>: matches all edit-log fields on pages such as <em>node/add/page</em>, <em>node/add/story</em>, etc.<br/><em>node/add/*.edit-user-*</em>: matches fields starting with <em>edit-user-</em> on pages starting with <em>node/add/</em></p>"
