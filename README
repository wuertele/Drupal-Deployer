A module for sharing cooking recipes

TODO
-----

- Get ingredients into the searchable Index. Requires some SQL expertise. See recipe_update_index()
- emit recipeXML for syndicating recipes. Anyone know of a standard format?
- let users maintain their own recipe collection just like a blog or personal image gallery
- integrate with bookmarks.module so users may create a 'recipe box' listing the favorite recipes
