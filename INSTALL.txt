What?
-----

This module provides a pingback user agent as specified in http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0 .  It is a better alternative to trackback, which already has a Drupal module and is used throughout the blogosphere (the world of blogs), especially those running WordPress blogging platform.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Upload the files to the webserver and enable Pingback module on the Modules page.
2. Create an input format used exclusively for pingbacks (http://example.com/admin/settings/filters/add).  The input format must be accessible by anonymous users (and should not be accessible by anybody else).
3. In the pingback configuration page (http://example.com/admin/settings/pingback), select the input format you have just created, and read all of the options carefully!
4. Go to content types administration page (http://example.com/admin/content/types) and enable pingbacks for any content types you wish (blog and story content types are pingback-enabled by default).  Nodes with Pingback-enabled content types can send and receive pingbacks.
5. Have fun pingbacking!
